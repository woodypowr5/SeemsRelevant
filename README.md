# SeemsRelevant.com

SeemsRelevant.com is the personal blog and homepage of Christopher Woodward, a front-end and JavaScript Web developer.

This website was initially conceived as a way for me to learn and utilize the front-end JavaScript framework AngularJS. However, as I have developed my skills in JavaScript, AngularJS and other Web technologies, I have decided to use the site to host my personal and professional Web presence, including my Web Development Portfolio and Resume, as well as a Blog and pages regarding my interests and endeavors in my personal life.
