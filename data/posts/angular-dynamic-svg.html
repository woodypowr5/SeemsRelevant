	I recently made the leap and decided to learn AngularJS. When I was hired, the company I was working for was doing a couple of projects in Angular, so I decided to expose myself to it just to see what all the hype was about and to ensure I had an idea what was goign on in  meetings. Unfortunately, I had also just started learning JavaScript a couple months before that. In addition, I hadn't seriously programed in several years, and my academic education didn't focus on web technologies or functional programming as much as I would have liked (or maybe I just didn't pay attention). Therefore, I found myself learning core JavaScript,  Jquery, AngularJS, CSS, HTML, Git, LESS and other enabling web technologies at the same time, which I imagine is a relatively common experience these days in the WebDev ecosystem, since we all start off at the same place, more or less, and many of these tchnologies are not taught (not in depth, anyway) in most universities' CS programs.

	As you've likely read elsewhere, and luckily for us, AngularJS is relatively simple in it's basic form, and can be leveraged at many different levels in order to add varying degrees funcionality to a website. At it's most in depth, Angular controls all aspects of App functionalty, including routing, data binding and data structure tools. However, it's also simple to add certain bits of functionality (like data binding, which Angular makes as easy as pie) and then leave it at that. It's pretty easy to do the simple stuff, but it gets quite complex to create whole webapps with Angular. A good dveloper should expect that, though, right? WebApps are complex structures, and Angular just gives you some better tools to manage=-0 them. It's all JavaScript after all, anyway, and as the Dev, you're still responsible for persuading the framework to do your will in the most elegant and convincing way possible.

	Given my experience learning Angular, I will pass on my lessons learned while learning basic Web Development as well. Once we learn something, it can be easy for programmers to take that information for granted, not quite remembering what it was like to start out and not know how things tied together, and not really knowing which questions to ask in order to figure it out. So, if you're an erxperienced WebDev, you may find that this article makes some pretty obvious points, but if you're new, hopefully my expereice can inform yours.</p>

<h2>The Case for AngularJS</h2>

<p>Angular is the only MVC framework that I have used. Therefore, I don't have the expertise to comment on it's relative difficulty/potential/etc. as far as other JavaScript frameworks go. However, I did quite a bit of research on the subject, and I've decided that Angular is worth sticking with. Here are some links that I found helpful:</p>

 	Probably the first thing that you will learn about in Angular is data binding, and this is because Angular can add some serious functionaliy to a website with very little effort. And at 142KB (as of this writing), it's not too expensive, either.

-allows you to add dynamic svg to your project in a semantically sound, testable and modular way. 

extends html, and allows you  (encourages you) to create sematically-sound html

lets you do cool things like this:
<fruit-basket apples="5" bananas="3" pears="2" colors="[red, yellow, green]"><fruit-basket>


If you are new to JavaScript, Angular will get difficult FAST. Also, this should be obvious. Javscript is a fairly quirky laguage, at least in my experience, and you should expect that the quirkyness of Javscript would make buidling anything on top JavaScript failry quirky, too, to some extent. Also, apps are comlplex, and some of the difficulty has nothing to do with JavaScript, but everything to do with complexity mangagement.

Some concept that will be likely to give you trouble:

	Scopeing (in particular, scoping scopes)

	Directives. Creating anything beyond trivial directives will required a proficient knowledge of variable scope, Angular's own tricky scoping conventions, and a host of other concepts. 

	Routing. Angular's built-in router is crap. You will probably need to use the separate <a href="">Angular-UI-Router</a>
