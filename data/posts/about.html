<h2 class="post-title">About This Site</h2>

<h3></h3>

<p>
	I've always had a lot of gratitude for all of the programmers out there who have taken the time to write about their experiences in blogs and articles, that I then happen to stumble onto, figuring out how to solve a problem that I've been working on. I wish that I were one of those people who could just go dig through the docs of a particular language or framework and somehow figure what I need to do to solve an issue. To be fair, sometimes I can do that, and sometimes I need to in order to figure out exactly how something works or to really learn the language or framework, but a lot of the time I just need to walk through the code that someone wrote to solve a similar problem, and then I have a much better shot at being able to extrapolate out how all the pieces need to work together in order to make my particular idea work. 
</p>
<p>
	So that, in a nutshell, is why I created this site. I wanted to document my problems and the solutions I found to them in order to help other coders solve similar problems. I also eventually wanted a platform on which I could connect and network with other coders. Lastly, a just wanted a place to put my thoughts down in writing where I could reflect on things that I find interesting or worthy of discussion, both in the domains of computer science and life in general.

<p>
	SeemsRelevant will always be a work-in-progress. I plan to continually add new features to the site, and to fully document how I created them as they are added. It is my wish that should an aspiring web developer visit this site, he or she will be able to find the information or the process required to create a site like this one, and by extention, anything that they can imagine in code. Please see the post "Code This Website" for more information. 
</p>
<p>
	At first, SeemsRelevant.com will only be implemented on the front end as a static site. In other words, the site can only be changed by editing the code directly, as information can't be stored anywhere in order to provide real-time content. As a result, certain features, though planned for future implementation, will not be available until I have the time to put together a back end for the site. These features basically include anything that can be updated or remembered, such as post comments, accounts, logging-in, or real-time messaging. While these features will being developed, if you have a comment or would like to communicate, please use the email link located at the bottom right of the page.

	Thank you for visiting. I hope you find something here that helps you become a better coder!
