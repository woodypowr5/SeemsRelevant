Data binding in Angular is powerful and simple

Make sure you have a solid grasp on Javascript syntax and data structures before learning angular.
	-Syntax was one of the trickier parts for me

Directives are awesome
	-They allow even more semantic html 

Directives are trickier than they look
	-dealing with scope and bindings can get interesting (parent-child scopes)

Creating a working UI is relatively simple process	

Every Javascript Dev should learn Jasmine
