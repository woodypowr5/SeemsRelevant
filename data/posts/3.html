<p>
	Trevor was accepted to the Academy during high school, and he left for Basic Training a month or so after graduation. While he was there, he was captain of an award-winning collegiate debate team, and he traveled and competed with the team in a bunch of different countries. All that, and he still managed to earn a spot in the top third of his class. All I know is if I missed that much class traveling, I probably would have been on academic probation the whole time. Great job Trev!

	Now, after he cashes in on a well-earned 60 days of leave, Trevor will be traveling to Boston where he will be stationed as an Acquisitions Officer at the Air Force base there. His job will involve procuring and fulfilling contracts for equipment and/or programs in the Air Force. He has some really great dreams for the future, and he, more than anyone else I know, has the drive to be able to do whatever it is that he puts his mind to.
