The motives behind creating this site were simple: to document solutions to problems that I have encountered during the web development process and to interact and network with other developers, and to post and discuss other things that I find intersting or useful. Since personal blogs and articles have been a huge source of realizations in the process of learning about coding and development, I figured that I would offer my two cents, and hopefully give someone the creative insight that they were searching for. Take a look around, and hopefully you can find something useful that will help you on your next project. ",

I am going to document this process as I experienced it through a series of articles in the Projects section. To start off, it will be a purely front-end project, and will utilize AngularJS.
